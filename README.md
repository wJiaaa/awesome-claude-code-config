# Awesome Claude Code Configuration

![Statusline](assets/statusline.png)

Production-ready configuration for [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) — one-command install of global instructions, multi-language coding rules (Python / TypeScript / Go), 20 curated plugins, custom skills (paper-reading, [adversarial-review](https://github.com/poteto/noodle/tree/main/.agents/skills/adversarial-review), [humanizer](https://github.com/blader/humanizer)), custom status bar, MCP integration, and a self-improvement loop that remembers corrections across sessions.

## Showcase

## Quick Start

### macOS / Linux

**One-line remote install** (no clone needed):

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mizoreww/awesome-claude-code-config/main/install.sh)
```

This launches the interactive selector. Add `--all` to install everything non-interactively.

**Local install** (from clone):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mizoreww/awesome-claude-code-config.git
cd awesome-claude-code-config
./install.sh              # Interactive selector
./install.sh --all        # Install everything (non-interactive)
```

### Windows

**One-line remote install** (PowerShell, no clone needed):

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mizoreww/awesome-claude-code-config/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

This launches the interactive selector. Use `.\install.ps1 -All` from a local clone for non-interactive full install.

**From CMD**:

```cmd
powershell -c "irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mizoreww/awesome-claude-code-config/main/install.ps1 | iex"
```

**Local install** (from clone):

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Mizoreww/awesome-claude-code-config.git
cd awesome-claude-code-config
.\install.ps1             # Interactive selector
```

### Interactive Installer

Running `./install.sh` with no arguments launches an interactive menu where you choose exactly what to install. Language rules and heavy plugins are **off by default** to keep context lean:

```
  ↑↓ move  Enter select  a=all n=none d=defaults q=quit

## Key Features

### Self-Improvement Loop

Two-tier memory with scope-based routing:

1. User corrects Claude → Claude judges scope: **cross-project** corrections go to `~/.claude/lessons.md`; **project-specific** preferences go to the project's `MEMORY.md`
2. Next session → `SessionStart` hook auto-injects global lessons; project `MEMORY.md` is auto-loaded by Claude Code
3. Pattern confirmed → rule promoted to `CLAUDE.md`

### SessionStart Hook

`settings.json` includes two `SessionStart` hooks:
- **startup**: Injects lessons.md when a new session starts
- **compact**: Re-injects lessons.md after context compaction

Replaces the previous approach of requiring manual `Read lessons.md` in CLAUDE.md (more reliable).

### Statusline

A single-line status bar with gradient progress bars, powered by `hooks/statusline.sh`:

- **Model** + **directory** + **virtual environment** (conda/venv/poetry/pipenv) + **git branch**
- **Context window**: gradient bar (green → yellow → red) with percentage and size
- **5-hour usage**: pulled from `api.anthropic.com/api/oauth/usage` (cached 60s), shows reset countdown
- Progress bars are fixed-width (20 chars) with 16-step color gradients

Configured via `statusLine` in `settings.json`:

```json
"statusLine": {
  "type": "command",
  "command": "bash $HOME/.claude/hooks/statusline.sh"
}
```

### Smart Settings Merge

When `settings.json` already exists, the installer performs a smart merge (Bash version requires `jq`; PowerShell version uses built-in JSON support):

- **env**: Incoming values as defaults, existing values take priority
- **permissions.allow**: Union of both arrays (deduped)
- **enabledPlugins**: Merged, existing keys take priority
- **hooks.SessionStart**: Deduplicated by `matcher` field
- **statusLine**: Incoming config takes priority

Without `jq`, a manual merge warning is shown instead.

### Layered Rules

```
common/       → Universal principles (always loaded)
  ↓ extended by
python/       → PEP 8, pytest, black, bandit
typescript/   → Zod, Playwright, Prettier
golang/       → gofmt, table-driven tests, gosec
```

### Plugin-First Approach

20 plugins across 5 marketplaces, organized into two groups:

**Core plugins** (14) — installed by default:

**AI Research plugins** (6) — select in the interactive menu or included with `--all`:

| Plugin | Marketplace | What It Does |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| [**tokenization**](https://github.com/Orchestra-Research/AI-Research-SKILLs) | ai-research-skills | HuggingFace Tokenizers, SentencePiece |

See [`plugins/README.md`](plugins/README.md) for installation details.

### Version Changelog Policy

CLAUDE.md includes a **Version Changelog** rule: when making version-level changes (new features, major refactors, breaking changes), Claude proactively maintains a `CHANGELOG.md` in the project root with structured entries covering features, design rationale, and caveats. This keeps design decisions traceable alongside the code.

### Custom Skills

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **paper-reading** | Structured research paper summarization with auto-screenshot of key figures. Uses ar5iv HTML for arXiv papers, Playwright for figure capture, outputs standardized markdown (problem, method, experiments, insights). |
| **[adversarial-review](https://github.com/poteto/noodle/tree/main/.agents/skills/adversarial-review)** | Cross-model adversarial code review. Spawns reviewers on the opposite AI model (Claude ↔ Codex) with distinct critical lenses (Skeptic, Architect, Minimalist), then synthesizes a structured verdict (PASS/CONTESTED/REJECT). |
| **[humanizer](https://github.com/blader/humanizer)** | Detect and remove AI writing patterns from text. Based on Wikipedia's "Signs of AI writing" guide, identifies 24 patterns across content, language, style, and communication categories (significance inflation, AI vocabulary, em dash overuse, sycophantic tone, etc.) and rewrites text to sound natural. |

Place custom skills in `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`.

### Adversarial Code Review via Codex CLI

CLAUDE.md includes a **Code Review** rule: whenever a code review is needed — whether requested by the user or triggered by a skill (e.g., `code-reviewer`, `simplify`) — Claude invokes the `adversarial-review` skill (from [poteto/noodle](https://github.com/poteto/noodle/tree/main/.agents/skills/adversarial-review)). This skill spawns reviewers on the **opposite AI model's CLI** (`codex exec` for Claude users, `claude -p` for Codex users), producing cross-model adversarial analysis with structured verdicts (PASS / CONTESTED / REJECT).

Requires Codex CLI installed and `OPENAI_API_KEY` set in your environment.

## Security Note

`settings.json` ships with `bypassPermissions` mode for power users. If you prefer safer defaults, change `defaultMode` to `"default"` and set `skipDangerousModePermissionPrompt` to `false`.

## Customization

- **Add a language**: Create `rules/<lang>/` extending common rules
- **Add a skill**: Place in `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
- **Adapt CLAUDE.md**: Customize for your shell, package manager, and project context
