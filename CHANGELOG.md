# Changelog

## [1.7.0] - 2026-03-11

### Features
- **All virtual environments in statusline**: Statusline now detects conda (including `base`), Python venv, poetry, and pipenv environments. Priority: conda > venv/poetry/pipenv
- **README documentation fixes**: Interactive menu example now lists humanizer skill; statusline description now mentions virtual environment display
- **Font install improvements**: Prioritized `fc-list` detection over filename glob (catches system-installed fonts); added explicit download timeouts (connect 10s, total 120s) to prevent hanging
- **Updated statusline screenshot**: Replaced showcase image with current statusline appearance

### Design Rationale
- Showing conda `base` is useful — users want to confirm which environment is active, even if it's the default
- `fc-list` is more reliable than filename globbing because system-packaged fonts may use different naming conventions
- Download timeout of 120s matches the Nerd Font zip size (~30MB) on slow connections while preventing indefinite hangs

### Notes & Caveats
- Virtual environment detection relies on environment variables (`CONDA_DEFAULT_ENV`, `VIRTUAL_ENV`); manually activated environments without these vars won't be detected
- Conda takes priority when both conda and venv are active simultaneously

## [1.6.0] - 2026-03-11

### Features
- **jq auto-install (bash)**: `install.sh` now auto-installs jq via package managers (brew/apt/dnf/yum/pacman/apk) or downloads a pre-built binary to `~/.claude/bin/jq` — settings.json smart merge no longer silently skips
- **Conda environment in statusline**: Shows active conda environment name between directory and git branch segments
- **Marketplace skip on re-install**: Installer checks if `~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/{name}` exists before retrying, saving ~75s on repeated installs
- **Emoji detection + text fallback**: Statusline detects UTF-8 locale, terminal type, and Nerd Font availability — falls back to text labels (`M:`, `D:`, `py:`, `br:`) on unsupported terminals
- **Nerd Font auto-install**: Installers download and install JetBrainsMono Nerd Font for Powerline git branch icon; prompts user to set terminal font

### Design Rationale
- jq install uses a layered approach: check PATH first, then `~/.claude/bin/`, then package managers (with sudo), then static binary download (no sudo needed) — covers CI, macOS, Linux desktop, and minimal containers
- Conda display shows all environments including `base` for environment awareness
- Marketplace directory check is the fastest reliable indicator of "already registered" — avoids 5x3s retry timeout from `claude plugin marketplace add` returning errors on duplicates
- Icon fallback chain: emoji (UTF-8 terminal) > Nerd Font (fc-list detected) > text labels (dumb/non-UTF-8 terminals) — ensures statusline is always readable

### Notes & Caveats
- jq binary download requires `curl` or `wget` and internet access; package manager installs may require `sudo`
- Nerd Font download is ~30MB; users must manually set their terminal font after installation
- Conda display reads `$CONDA_DEFAULT_ENV` — works with conda activate but not with direct `python` path manipulation

## [1.5.1] - 2026-03-09

### Features
- **Remote install now interactive by default**: One-line installs (`curl | bash`, `bash <(curl ...)`) launch the interactive selector — reads keyboard from `/dev/tty` when stdin is piped, or from stdin directly when it's a tty
- **`confirm()` prompt also supports piped stdin**: Uninstall confirmation prompts now pair output and input through the same device (`/dev/tty` when piped, stdout+stdin when normal)
- **Centralized terminal detection**: Single `can_interact()` function replaces duplicated checks across `parse_args`, `interactive_menu`, and `confirm`

### Design Rationale
- `bash <(curl ...)` already preserves terminal stdin; the `/dev/tty` fallback specifically enables `curl URL | bash` where stdin carries the script
- Interactive menu prefers stdin (fd 0) when it's a tty, only opening `/dev/tty` as fallback — no regression for containers missing `/dev/tty`
- Only falls back to default install (essential plugins only) when neither stdin nor `/dev/tty` is available (e.g., headless CI)

## [1.5.0] - 2026-03-09

### Features
- **Windows interactive installer**: `install.ps1` now has the same arrow-key interactive menu as bash, using `[Console]::ReadKey()` for navigation
- **Windows CLI simplified**: PowerShell params reduced to `-All`, `-Uninstall`, `-Version`, `-DryRun`, `-Force` (matching bash)
- **Windows plugin groups aligned**: Essential (13) + claude-mem (1) + AI Research (6) structure now matches bash installer
- **Windows language rule cleanup**: Unselected language dirs are auto-removed, matching bash behavior

## [1.4.0] - 2026-03-09

### Features
- **Interactive installer**: `./install.sh` with no args launches a multi-select menu — toggle components by number, confirm with Enter
- **Plugin groups simplified**: All 13 general plugins merged into one Essential group (on by default); claude-mem separated as standalone toggle (off by default)
  - Essential (13): everything-claude-code, superpowers, code-review, context7, commit-commands, document-skills, playwright, feature-dev, code-simplifier, ralph-loop, frontend-design, example-skills, github
  - claude-mem (1): separated — injects ~3k tokens/session (observation index + session summary)
- **Language rules opt-in**: Python/TypeScript/Go rules are off by default in interactive mode — only install what your projects need
- **Automatic cleanup**: When selecting specific language rules, previously installed unselected language dirs are removed
- **Arrow-key interactive menu**: ↑↓ navigate, Enter to toggle, Submit button to confirm
- **CLI simplified**: Removed 8 component-selection flags (`--rules`, `--plugins`, `--mcp`, `--skills`, `--lessons`, `--hooks`, `--claude-md`, `--settings`); only `--all`, `--uninstall`, `--version`, `--dry-run`, `--force` remain
- **`--all` now installs everything**: Including MCP and all plugin groups (previously excluded MCP)

### Design Rationale
- Addresses context accumulation issue (#7): default install was injecting ~9k tokens of rules (including unused languages) + heavy plugin skill lists into every session
- Interactive menu replaces the need to remember CLI flags — users see all options at a glance with sensible defaults
- CLI flag removal: component-selection flags are redundant with the interactive menu; `--all` is the only non-interactive install path needed
- claude-mem separated as standalone toggle — it's the only plugin injecting ~3k tokens at SessionStart (observation index + session summary); other Extended plugins only register tool/skill names
- Non-interactive fallback preserved: headless/CI installs (no tty at all) install essential plugins only (no MCP); explicit `--all` installs everything including MCP and all plugin groups
- Unknown/removed CLI flags now exit with error instead of silently degrading

### Notes & Caveats
- `--all` now installs everything (all plugins, MCP, all language rules)
- Remote install (`bash <(curl ...)`) now shows interactive menu by default (v1.5.1+); add `--all` for non-interactive full install

## [1.3.0] - 2026-03-09

### Features
- Full uninstall now includes plugins and MCP by default (previously omitted)
- Install warning tracking: failed merges or plugin installs now skip version stamp and report warning count
- Uninstall backs up `settings.json` to `settings.json.bak` before removal
- `--all` flag now composes with other flags (e.g., `--all --mcp` installs everything plus MCP)
- Windows installer checks bash availability and warns if missing (required by statusline and hooks)
- Adversarial review skill no longer requires missing `brain/principles.md`; uses `reviewer-lenses.md` as self-contained source

### Bug Fixes
- VERSION environment variable sanitized to prevent command injection in remote install
- Repeated install no longer creates nested directories (e.g., `paper-reading/paper-reading/`)
- `stat` fallback order fixed: Linux `stat -c %Y` tried first, macOS `stat -f %m` as fallback
- Windows installer missing `tokenization` plugin in AI Research group (5/6 → 6/6)

### Documentation
- Self-improvement loop wording clarified: "auto-saved" → "Claude writes corrections driven by CLAUDE.md instructions"
- Uninstall examples annotated with "(incl. plugins & MCP)"
- Manual plugin install docs updated with all marketplace `add` commands and `name@marketplace` syntax

### Design Rationale
- Warning tracking prevents users from believing a partially-failed install is current
- Settings backup on uninstall prevents accidental loss of user-owned config merged by the installer
- VERSION sanitization closes a real attack vector in the remote install path (`bash -c` with untrusted input)

### Notes & Caveats
- `bypassPermissions` default unchanged (power-user config by design)
- Adversarial review still requires opposite CLI (`codex`/`claude`) — this is by design, not a bug

## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-07

### Features
- Windows support with PowerShell installer (`install.ps1`)
- Adversarial code review skill (cross-model review via opposite AI CLI)
- Tokenization plugin added to AI Research skill group (huggingface-tokenizers, sentencepiece)
- Cross-platform web search date instruction (system command with fallback)
- Codex branch link in README navigation

### Bug Fixes
- Statusline non-blocking for third-party API users
- Bash 3.2 compatibility (replace associative array with string matching)
- Retry logic (5 attempts) for network operations in installer
- Fallback to expired cache when usage API is rate-limited

### Design Rationale
- PowerShell installer mirrors bash installer logic for Windows parity
- Adversarial review replaces codex-cli MCP — cross-model challenge produces higher quality reviews than same-model delegation
- Web search date instruction ensures queries include current year by verifying system clock first

### Notes & Caveats
- PowerShell installer requires `winget` for `jq`/`gh` dependencies
- Adversarial review requires the opposite CLI installed (`codex` for Claude users, `claude` for Codex users)
- GitHub redirect from old repo name (`claude-code-config`) still works but canonical URL is now `awesome-claude-code-config`

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-05

### Features
- Gradient statusline showing model, cost, and context usage
- Version changelog policy in CLAUDE.md
- Project renamed to `awesome-claude-code-config`
- Backup logic removed from installer (replaced by smart merge)

### Design Rationale
- Statusline provides at-a-glance session awareness without interrupting workflow
- Changelog policy ensures design decisions are traceable alongside code

### Notes & Caveats
- Statusline reads from OS keychain for API credentials — requires keychain access
- Rename may break existing bookmarks; GitHub redirect handles this transparently

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-02

### Features
- Installer overhaul: remote install, smart merge, plugin groups, uninstall, version management
- Enhanced paper-reading skill with depth-first analysis and multi-perspective evaluation
- Code Review rule in CLAUDE.md
- Codex CLI MCP server integration

### Design Rationale
- Plugin-first architecture: skills installed from open-source ecosystems rather than bundled
- Smart merge preserves user customizations during upgrades
- Paper-reading skill uses Andrew Ng's three-perspective framework for balanced evaluation

### Notes & Caveats
- Plugin installer requires Python 3 and network access to GitHub
- MCP servers require separate credential configuration (Lark, GitHub PAT)

## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-25

### Features
- Initial release with CLAUDE.md global instructions
- Memory system with lessons-based self-correction loop
- Plugin marketplace with AI research, MCP servers, and paper-reading skill
- Feishu/Lark MCP and Context7 integration
- Installer with plugin group support

### Design Rationale
- Lessons-driven self-improvement: corrections recorded → auto-injected → stable patterns promoted to CLAUDE.md
- Plugin marketplace separates concern: CLAUDE.md manages behavior, plugins provide domain skills

### Notes & Caveats
- First public release — API and configuration format may change
