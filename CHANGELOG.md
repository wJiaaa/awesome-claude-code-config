# Changelog

## [2.5.2] - 2026-04-21

### Refactor
- **Swap `env.CLAUDE_CODE_NO_FLICKER` for top-level `"tui": "fullscreen"`**: the `tui` setting is the schema-native way to select the flicker-free alt-screen renderer. Per the official schema it is "equivalent to `CLAUDE_CODE_NO_FLICKER=1`". Using the schema field is more discoverable, validates against settings.json's JSON Schema, and keeps `env` reserved for variables that have no native setting.

### Notes & Caveats
- Behaviour is identical — same fullscreen renderer, same virtualized scrollback.
- `env` still carries `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS` and `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_ADAPTIVE_THINKING` because neither has a schema-native equivalent (`alwaysThinkingEnabled: false` disables thinking entirely, which is not what we want).

## [2.5.1] - 2026-04-21

### Bug Fixes
- **`effortLevel` default changed from `max` to `xhigh`**: `max` is not accepted as a persistent default — Claude Code only allows `low`/`medium`/`high`/`xhigh` for `effortLevel` in `settings.json` (and for `CLAUDE_CODE_EFFORT_LEVEL`). The `max` tier is intentionally session-scoped and must be set per session via `/effort max`. The previous default was silently ignored.
- **Removed `betas: ["extended-cache-ttl-2025-04-11"]`**: the 1-hour prompt cache TTL is now generally available, so the beta header is no longer required. The expired beta ID was dead configuration.

### Notes & Caveats
- If you want `max` reasoning effort, invoke `/effort max` per session — this is Anthropic's deliberate design for the top tier.
- 1h cache TTL continues to work natively after removing the beta header.

## [2.5.0] - 2026-04-21

### Features
- **New plugin: `andrej-karpathy-skills`** (marketplace `karpathy-skills` at `forrestchang/andrej-karpathy-skills`) enabled by default. Adds Karpathy-inspired behavioural guidelines (Think-Before-Coding, Simplicity-First, Surgical Changes, Goal-Driven Execution) to reduce common LLM coding mistakes.
- **`everything-claude-code` now default disabled**. Moved out of the essential plugin group into an optional group; only installed via explicit `--all` or manual opt-in.
- **Installer respects plugin de-selection**: when running the installer, any plugin that the user did NOT select but that already exists in their local `settings.json` (or is known to the installer catalogue) is now written as `false` in `enabledPlugins`. Previously, unselected plugins could silently remain enabled because the merge logic preferred existing values.
- **Menu reorganisation**: the "Plugins — Official" and "Plugins — Community" groups have been replaced with four usage-oriented groups and the old "Skills" group has been dissolved into them. Plugins and skills now live side-by-side in the same category, since they serve the same workflow:
  - **Workflow** (8): andrej-karpathy-skills, superpowers, feature-dev, ralph-loop, commit-commands, code-simplifier, everything-claude-code, `update-config` (skill)
  - **Integrations** (3): context7, github, playwright
  - **Design & Content** (5): document-skills, example-skills, frontend-design, `humanizer` (skill), `humanizer-zh` (skill)
  - **Memory & Lifestyle** (3): claude-mem, claude-health, PUA
  - **Academic Research** (10): `paper-reading` (skill) + 6 AI-Research plugins + 3 DeepXiv skills (previously 9)
  Group labels no longer carry the redundant "Plugins —" prefix.

### Design Rationale
- Karpathy's guidelines are general-purpose heuristics that apply to most coding sessions, so they belong in the essentials group. Everything-claude-code is broad and opinionated; making it opt-in reduces surprise overlap with user-selected standards.
- The new enabledPlugins rule makes the interactive menu authoritative: what you pick is what's enabled. Unknown keys from the existing settings.json that are not in our catalogue are still preserved so manually-added plugins aren't clobbered.

### Bug Fixes (post-review)
- **`enabledPlugins` catalogue now includes the current selection**. Previously, plugins selected in the menu but not declared in the shipped `settings.json` (e.g. `codex@openai-codex`, `health@claude-health`, `pua@pua-skills`) were installed by `claude plugin install` but silently omitted from `enabledPlugins` — Claude Code treated them as disabled. The selection-aware rebuild now unions base keys with `$selected`.
- **Fallback merge order corrected**. When plugins aren't interacted with this run, the union merge now has existing values winning on conflict (`$base * $over` in jq, `$mergeHt $incoming $existing` in PowerShell). Previously the operands were swapped, silently flipping v2.4.x users' `everything-claude-code: true` to `false` on any upgrade that didn't touch plugins.
- **`install_jq` hoisted in `install_settings`**. Fresh installs on jq-less machines with statusline+lessons both on no longer silently skip the plugin selection filter.
- **Dry-run banner now reflects actual semantics**. Previously `--dry-run` printed "enabledPlugins: union (new plugins added, existing preserved)" even when the real run would do a selection-aware rebuild — now branches on `$INSTALL_PLUGINS`.

### Windows Menu Parity
- Install.ps1 now accepts **→ (Right arrow)** to open a group's sub-menu and **← (Left arrow)** to return, matching install.sh. Hint strings updated in both scripts.
- README documents the full key bindings: main menu (↑↓ / Enter or → / q), sub-menu (↑↓ / Space / ← or Esc), and shortcuts (a / n / d).

### Notes & Caveats
- `PLUGINS_OPTIONAL` group added alongside `PLUGINS_ESSENTIAL` (install.sh and install.ps1). `--all` mode expands to include both.
- The selection-aware enabledPlugins merge only activates when the installer touches plugins (`INSTALL_PLUGINS=true`). If you install only `settings.json` without any plugin selection, the fallback union merge preserves existing state.
- Existing users: your previously-enabled plugins stay enabled only if re-selected in the menu. Run the interactive menu to adjust.
- README.md and README.zh-CN.md significantly trimmed (from 349 → ~195 lines): the per-plugin duplication that overlapped with `plugins/README.md` has been collapsed, while the full interactive-menu catalogue is kept inline with links and defaults.

## [2.4.0] - 2026-04-21

### Features
- **Default permission mode `auto`**: `settings.json` ships with `permissions.defaultMode = "auto"` so Claude autonomously approves safe actions and blocks risky ones. Installer auto-detects Claude Code version and downgrades to `bypassPermissions` on versions older than 2.1.80 (existing logic, unchanged).
- **Max reasoning effort default**: `effortLevel: "max"` at the top level of `settings.json`. Pins `/effort` to the highest tier by default; fall back to `xhigh` / `high` automatically on older CLIs that reject `max`.
- **1-hour prompt cache TTL**: `betas: ["extended-cache-ttl-2025-04-11"]` enables extended prompt caching (1h) instead of the default 5-minute TTL, reducing cache churn on long sessions.
- **Flicker-free rendering**: `env.CLAUDE_CODE_NO_FLICKER = "1"` switches to fullscreen rendering mode (equivalent to `/tui fullscreen`).
- **Adaptive thinking disabled by default**: `env.CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_ADAPTIVE_THINKING = "1"` pins thinking budget to `MAX_THINKING_TOKENS` instead of adapting per-turn. No effect on Opus 4.7 (always adaptive).

### Design Rationale
- Keeping these as a single "one knob on" default set simplifies onboarding — users who want the stock behaviour change one value; users who don't care get the fast path.
- Unknown keys (`effortLevel`, `betas`) are silently ignored by older Claude Code versions, so no version gating needed in the installer.
- `auto` mode is the only default that genuinely needs fallback; the existing `_supports_auto_mode` check in `install.sh` handles that.

### Notes & Caveats
- `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_ADAPTIVE_THINKING` and `CLAUDE_CODE_NO_FLICKER` are recognised by Claude Code 2.1.104+. On earlier versions they are harmless no-ops.
- Adaptive thinking is always on for Opus 4.7 regardless of the env var — change `model` if you need strict fixed-budget behaviour.

## [2.3.1] - 2026-04-12

### Bug Fixes
- **Windows remote install crash**: Fixed `ParameterBindingException` when running `irm URL | iex` on PowerShell 5.x. Internal tokens like `"adversarial-review"` leaked into `$args` and were splatted as positional arguments to `Invoke-Expression`. Now filters `$args` to only pass recognized switch-style arguments (starting with `-`).

### Design Rationale
- `$_safeArgs` filter replaces raw `@args` splatting — keeps `.\install.ps1 -All` working locally while preventing garbage token leakage in `irm | iex` piped mode.

## [2.3.0] - 2026-04-10

### Features
- **Adaptive statusline wrapping**: Statusline now dynamically wraps segments to the next line based on terminal width instead of being truncated. Uses visible-width calculation with ANSI-aware measurement.
- **Adaptive progress bar sizing**: Context and 5h usage progress bars shrink (min 8 chars) when terminal space is tight, staying on the same line when possible.
- **Smart terminal width detection**: Walks ancestor process file descriptors via `/proc/$PID/fd/` to find the real terminal in pipe contexts where `$COLUMNS` and `tput cols` are unreliable.
- **DeepXiv SDK integration**: New Academic Research group with `deepxiv_sdk` plugin for academic paper search and analysis.

### Bug Fixes
- **COLUMNS=0 in pipe context**: Claude Code passes empty/zero `COLUMNS` to statusline subprocess; now detected and falls back to fd probing.
- **macOS `wc -L` fallback**: `visible_len()` falls back to `${#stripped}` on platforms where `wc -L` is unavailable (BSD/macOS).
- **Negative bar sizing clamp**: When preceding segments exceed available space, adaptive bar sizing now correctly clamps instead of silently using full 20-char width.
- **Width cache**: Segment widths cached in parallel array, reducing subshell forks from ~13 to ~7 per render.

### Design Rationale
- Segment array architecture replaces string concatenation for clean separation of layout concerns
- PPID fd walk is more correct than `/dev/pts/*` glob which could read another session's terminal
- `visible_len()` uses `wc -L` (GNU) for emoji/CJK double-width accuracy with `${#}` fallback for portability

### Notes & Caveats
- Wrapping only occurs at segment boundaries; a single segment wider than terminal will overflow naturally
- Hardcoded label overhead estimates (18/14 chars) may drift by 1-2 chars on edge cases

## [2.2.0] - 2026-04-02

### Features
- **Two-level interactive menu**: Main menu shows group summaries (`[selected/total]`); Enter/→ opens sub-menus, ←/Esc returns. Groups: Core, Language Rules, Review, Skills, Plugins — Official/Community/AI Research, MCP Servers.
- **Review tool selector**: New "Review" group — `code-review` plugin (ON), `adversarial-review` skill (ON), Codex CLI (OFF). adversarial-review and Codex are mutually exclusive with auto-toggle.
- **Restored adversarial-review skill**: Cross-model reviewers (Claude↔Codex) with Skeptic/Architect/Minimalist lenses from [poteto/noodle](https://github.com/poteto/noodle).
- **New humanizer-zh skill**: Chinese AI writing pattern removal from [op7418/Humanizer-zh](https://github.com/op7418/Humanizer-zh).
- **Per-plugin granularity**: All 23 plugins individually selectable (previously bundled into groups).
- **Dynamic CLAUDE.md Code Review section**: Installer rewrites the Code Review rule based on selected review tool.
- **Arrow key navigation**: ←/→ supported for sub-menu entry/exit in addition to Enter/Esc.

### Bug Fixes (bash 5.x / Linux)
- **Root cause**: `(( var++ ))` from 0 returns exit code 1 under bash 5.x `set -e`, silently killing the script. macOS bash 3.2 does not trigger `set -e` on this. Fixed all instances: `(( flat_idx++ ))` → `(( ++flat_idx ))`, `(( fixed++ ))` → `(( ++fixed ))`, `(( selected[j] )) && (( cnt++ ))` → added `|| true`.
- **`[[ ]] && cmd` without `|| true`**: `_enforce_review_mutex` and main menu ALL handler crashed when the last loop iteration didn't match. Added `|| true` guards to all `[[ test ]] && assignment` patterns.
- **`local _menu_active`**: Trap handlers couldn't access local variables under bash 5.x; changed to global.
- **install.ps1**: Removed stale `$groups` override that destroyed menu data, causing Windows interactive menu crash.
- **Terminal fd probe**: Detects broken `/dev/tty` (EOF) and falls back to non-interactive default install. Only rejects EOF (ret=1), not stray input bytes (ret=0).
- **EXIT trap**: Added `_menu_cleanup` to EXIT trap to restore terminal on unexpected exit (prevents stuck alternate screen).

### Design Rationale
- Two-level menu keeps the main view compact while allowing fine-grained control
- Mutual exclusion prevents conflicting review tools from being installed simultaneously
- All `(( ))` arithmetic and `[[ ]] && cmd` patterns now systematically protected against `set -e`
- fd probe provides defense-in-depth without false positives

### Notes & Caveats
- `--all` installs everything with adversarial-review (not Codex) as default
- Codex CLI selection automatically installs `codex@openai-codex` plugin
- adversarial-review skill requires `codex` CLI for cross-model review

## [2.1.0] - 2026-04-02

### Features
- **Codex adversarial-review plugin**: Replaced the built-in `adversarial-review` skill with the official [Codex plugin](https://github.com/openai/codex-plugin-cc) (`codex@openai-codex`). Code reviews now use `/codex:adversarial-review` with automatic fallback to Claude's `code-reviewer` agent when Codex is unavailable. Plugin is included in the default installation.
- **Skill rename**: Reverted `/update` back to `/update-config` — directory renamed from `skills/update/` to `skills/update-config/` to match. Installer cleans up legacy `skills/update` and `skills/adversarial-review` paths on upgrade.
- **Smart-merge enabledPlugins strategy**: Changed from "existing wins" to "union" — new plugins from incoming config are now added alongside existing ones, ensuring upgrades pick up new plugins like `codex@openai-codex` automatically.

### Design Rationale
- The Codex plugin provides a maintained, official adversarial review implementation with shared runtime and better integration
- Namespaced skill commands (`update-config`) prevent accidental shadowing of project-level `/update` commands across all repositories
- Union merge for `enabledPlugins` ensures upgrade users automatically get new plugins without losing their existing configuration
- Fallback review path (`code-reviewer` agent) ensures code review works even without Codex CLI or OpenAI API key

### Notes & Caveats
- Codex plugin requires authentication via `codex login` (run `/codex:setup` to check status)
- The `docs/adversarial-review-showcase.md` is preserved as historical reference
- CHANGELOG history entries for `update_config` and `adversarial-review` are preserved as-is
- Installer migration automatically removes legacy `skills/update` and `skills/adversarial-review` directories

## [2.0.0] - 2026-03-27

### Features
- **Auto mode default**: `settings.json` now ships with `defaultMode: "auto"` instead of `bypassPermissions`. Auto mode (announced 2026-03-24) lets Claude approve safe actions autonomously while blocking risky ones — a safer middle ground for power users. Installer auto-detects Claude Code version and falls back to `bypassPermissions` for versions < 2.1.80.

### Design Rationale
- Auto mode classifies each tool call for risk before execution; safe operations proceed, risky ones are blocked
- Version detection in `install.sh` (`_supports_auto_mode`) ensures backward compatibility without user intervention
- Distinguishes "Claude Code not installed" vs "version too old" in warning messages

### Notes & Caveats
- Auto mode requires Claude Sonnet 4.6 or Opus 4.6 model; not available on Haiku, claude-3 models, or third-party providers (Bedrock, Vertex, Foundry)
- Auto mode is a research preview on Team plans; Enterprise and API support rolling out
- `sed -i` fallback replaced with portable `sed > tmp && mv` for macOS compatibility

## [1.9.4] - 2026-03-27

### Features
- **paper-reading skill**: Replaced unreliable ar5iv HTML + Playwright screenshot pipeline with pure PDF + pymupdf4llm automatic extraction. Figures, vector graphics, and tables are now extracted directly from PDF with `pymupdf4llm.to_markdown(write_images=True)`, then filtered and renamed automatically.

### Design Rationale
- ar5iv coverage is incomplete — many papers lack HTML versions, causing the screenshot flow to fail entirely
- pymupdf4llm wraps `get_images()` + `cluster_drawings()` + `get_pixmap(clip=...)` into a single call, handling both raster and vector figures automatically
- Added graceful degradation: theoretical papers with no meaningful figures produce text-only summaries

### Notes & Caveats
- Requires `pymupdf4llm` package (auto-installs `pymupdf` as dependency)
- OCR disabled by default (`use_ocr=False`) to avoid tesseract dependency
- Template image placeholders changed from hardcoded `figure_X.png` to HTML comment guides

## [1.9.3] - 2026-03-26

### Features
- **PUA plugin**: Added [tanweai/pua](https://github.com/tanweai/pua) as a new plugin group — AI agent productivity booster with multi-language support (CN/EN/JA), forces exhaustive problem-solving and systematic debugging

### Design Rationale
- PUA is a popular community plugin that significantly improves agent persistence and problem-solving thoroughness
- Added as an opt-in group (default off) to keep the install lightweight for users who don't need it

### Notes & Caveats
- New marketplace `pua-skills` added (total: 7 marketplaces, 22 plugins)
- Both install.sh and install.ps1 updated with new plugin group, menu item, dispatch, and uninstall support
- Both README.md and README.zh-CN.md updated with plugin tables

## [1.9.2] - 2026-03-20

### Features
- **Bundled MesloLGS NF font**: Replaced online JetBrainsMono Nerd Font download (~30MB zip from GitHub) with 4 bundled MesloLGS NF .ttf files (~10MB total) — font installation is now instant with no network dependency

### Design Rationale
- GitHub releases download was slow/unreliable in poor network environments, blocking the entire install flow
- MesloLGS NF is a well-established Nerd Font (used by Powerlevel10k) that provides the same Powerline/icon glyphs needed for statusline
- Bundling ~10MB of fonts in the repo is an acceptable trade-off vs requiring network access during install

### Notes & Caveats
- Font files sourced from romkatv/powerlevel10k-media (Apache 2.0 license)
- Both install.sh and install.ps1 updated — no more curl/wget/Invoke-WebRequest for fonts
- Terminal font setting prompt now recommends 'MesloLGS NF' instead of 'JetBrainsMono Nerd Font'

## [1.9.1] - 2026-03-17

### Features
- **paper-reading pymupdf fixes**: Fixed 5 issues from adversarial code review — removed Step 1/Step 3 contradiction blocking PDF figure extraction, added vector figure detection guidance (`get_drawings()`/`get_text("dict")`), fixed output path consistency, clarified `extract_image` vs clip-based rendering usage, added pymupdf availability pre-check
- **Adversarial Review showcase**: Added adversarial-review skill showcase with 4 screenshots demonstrating the cross-model review workflow (scope analysis → reviewer spawning → verdict synthesis → lead judgment)

### Design Rationale
- The Step 1 "Cannot screenshot figures" message contradicted the new Path B pymupdf workflow — agents following the acquisition flow would stop before reaching figure extraction
- Vector figure detection is essential because many research papers encode plots, diagrams, and tables as vector/text objects rather than raster images
- `extract_image(xref)` returns raw embedded images without page-level annotations — clip-based rendering is safer as the default for most figure types

### Notes & Caveats
- pymupdf (`pip install pymupdf`) is required for Path B PDF figure extraction
- Adversarial review showcase screenshots are from a real review session

## [1.9.0] - 2026-03-14

### Features
- **claude-health plugin**: Added [claude-health](https://github.com/tw93/claude-health) as a new standalone plugin group in the interactive installer — provides health check and wellness dashboard for Claude Code sessions
- **Statusline bugfix**: Fixed `fmt_ctx()` integer comparison error when context size is empty — `local s=$1` → `local s=${1:-0}` prevents `[: : integer expression expected` warnings

### Design Rationale
- claude-health is a standalone group (like claude-mem) rather than part of Essential — it's optional and users may not want health monitoring overhead
- The statusline fix uses shell parameter expansion default (`${1:-0}`) which is POSIX-compatible and handles both empty and unset variables

### Notes & Caveats
- claude-health marketplace source: `tw93/claude-health` (GitHub)
- Total plugin count: 21 across 6 marketplaces (was 20 across 5)

## [1.8.2] - 2026-03-13

### Features
- **StatusLine and Lessons are now independent menu options**: The former "Hooks" item has been split into "StatusLine" (gradient progress bar & usage display) and "Lessons" (lessons.md template + SessionStart auto-load hook). Users can now install either without the other.
- **Conditional settings.json merge**: `statusLine` and `hooks.SessionStart` fields are only merged/included when their corresponding menu option is selected
- **Auto-enable settings.json**: Selecting StatusLine or Lessons without settings.json will auto-enable settings.json (required for config)
- **jq-unavailable warning**: Fresh installs without jq now warn when unselected fields cannot be stripped from settings.json

### Design Rationale
- Addresses issue #12: users who don't want the statusline can now deselect it independently
- The old "Hooks" item bundled two unrelated concerns — statusline display and lessons auto-loading — that have different use cases
- `install_statusline()` now only copies `statusline.sh` (not all files in hooks/), preventing future hook files from being bundled incorrectly

### Notes & Caveats
- Existing users who re-run the installer with StatusLine/Lessons unchecked will keep their existing config (safe upgrade — the installer never removes previously installed settings)
- On systems without jq, fresh installs with partial selections will copy the full settings.json template and warn about included extra fields

## [1.8.0] - 2026-03-11

### Features
- **`/update_config` skill**: In-session update command — type `/update_config` in Claude Code to check for new versions and re-run the interactive installer without leaving the session. Compares installed vs remote VERSION, downloads latest `install.sh`, and launches the interactive selector.

### Design Rationale
- Skill-based approach (vs. a standalone script) lets users update from within any Claude Code session with a single slash command, no terminal switching needed
- Reuses the existing `install.sh` remote mode and smart merge — no new update logic to maintain

### Notes & Caveats
- Requires internet access to fetch remote VERSION and installer
- The installer's smart merge preserves existing `settings.json` customizations and never overwrites `lessons.md`

## [1.7.0] - 2026-03-11

### Features
- **All virtual environments in statusline**: Statusline now detects conda (including `base`), Python venv, poetry, and pipenv environments. Priority: conda > venv/poetry/pipenv
- **README documentation fixes**: Interactive menu example now lists humanizer skill; statusline description now mentions virtual environment display
- **Font install improvements**: Prioritized `fc-list` detection over filename glob (catches system-installed fonts); added explicit download timeouts (connect 10s, total 120s) to prevent hanging
- **Updated statusline screenshot**: Replaced showcase image with current statusline appearance

### Design Rationale
- Showing conda `base` is useful — users want to confirm which environment is active, even if it's the default
- `fc-list` is more reliable than filename globbing because system-packaged fonts may use different naming conventions
- Download timeout of 120s matches the Nerd Font zip size (~30MB) on slow connections while preventing indefinite hangs

### Notes & Caveats
- Virtual environment detection relies on environment variables (`CONDA_DEFAULT_ENV`, `VIRTUAL_ENV`); manually activated environments without these vars won't be detected
- Conda takes priority when both conda and venv are active simultaneously

## [1.6.0] - 2026-03-11

### Features
- **jq auto-install (bash)**: `install.sh` now auto-installs jq via package managers (brew/apt/dnf/yum/pacman/apk) or downloads a pre-built binary to `~/.claude/bin/jq` — settings.json smart merge no longer silently skips
- **Conda environment in statusline**: Shows active conda environment name between directory and git branch segments
- **Marketplace skip on re-install**: Installer checks if `~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/{name}` exists before retrying, saving ~75s on repeated installs
- **Emoji detection + text fallback**: Statusline detects UTF-8 locale, terminal type, and Nerd Font availability — falls back to text labels (`M:`, `D:`, `py:`, `br:`) on unsupported terminals
- **Nerd Font auto-install**: Installers download and install JetBrainsMono Nerd Font for Powerline git branch icon; prompts user to set terminal font

### Design Rationale
- jq install uses a layered approach: check PATH first, then `~/.claude/bin/`, then package managers (with sudo), then static binary download (no sudo needed) — covers CI, macOS, Linux desktop, and minimal containers
- Conda display shows all environments including `base` for environment awareness
- Marketplace directory check is the fastest reliable indicator of "already registered" — avoids 5x3s retry timeout from `claude plugin marketplace add` returning errors on duplicates
- Icon fallback chain: emoji (UTF-8 terminal) > Nerd Font (fc-list detected) > text labels (dumb/non-UTF-8 terminals) — ensures statusline is always readable

### Notes & Caveats
- jq binary download requires `curl` or `wget` and internet access; package manager installs may require `sudo`
- Nerd Font download is ~30MB; users must manually set their terminal font after installation
- Conda display reads `$CONDA_DEFAULT_ENV` — works with conda activate but not with direct `python` path manipulation

## [1.5.1] - 2026-03-09

### Features
- **Remote install now interactive by default**: One-line installs (`curl | bash`, `bash <(curl ...)`) launch the interactive selector — reads keyboard from `/dev/tty` when stdin is piped, or from stdin directly when it's a tty
- **`confirm()` prompt also supports piped stdin**: Uninstall confirmation prompts now pair output and input through the same device (`/dev/tty` when piped, stdout+stdin when normal)
- **Centralized terminal detection**: Single `can_interact()` function replaces duplicated checks across `parse_args`, `interactive_menu`, and `confirm`

### Design Rationale
- `bash <(curl ...)` already preserves terminal stdin; the `/dev/tty` fallback specifically enables `curl URL | bash` where stdin carries the script
- Interactive menu prefers stdin (fd 0) when it's a tty, only opening `/dev/tty` as fallback — no regression for containers missing `/dev/tty`
- Only falls back to default install (essential plugins only) when neither stdin nor `/dev/tty` is available (e.g., headless CI)

## [1.5.0] - 2026-03-09

### Features
- **Windows interactive installer**: `install.ps1` now has the same arrow-key interactive menu as bash, using `[Console]::ReadKey()` for navigation
- **Windows CLI simplified**: PowerShell params reduced to `-All`, `-Uninstall`, `-Version`, `-DryRun`, `-Force` (matching bash)
- **Windows plugin groups aligned**: Essential (13) + claude-mem (1) + AI Research (6) structure now matches bash installer
- **Windows language rule cleanup**: Unselected language dirs are auto-removed, matching bash behavior

## [1.4.0] - 2026-03-09

### Features
- **Interactive installer**: `./install.sh` with no args launches a multi-select menu — toggle components by number, confirm with Enter
- **Plugin groups simplified**: All 13 general plugins merged into one Essential group (on by default); claude-mem separated as standalone toggle (off by default)
  - Essential (13): everything-claude-code, superpowers, code-review, context7, commit-commands, document-skills, playwright, feature-dev, code-simplifier, ralph-loop, frontend-design, example-skills, github
  - claude-mem (1): separated — injects ~3k tokens/session (observation index + session summary)
- **Language rules opt-in**: Python/TypeScript/Go rules are off by default in interactive mode — only install what your projects need
- **Automatic cleanup**: When selecting specific language rules, previously installed unselected language dirs are removed
- **Arrow-key interactive menu**: ↑↓ navigate, Enter to toggle, Submit button to confirm
- **CLI simplified**: Removed 8 component-selection flags (`--rules`, `--plugins`, `--mcp`, `--skills`, `--lessons`, `--hooks`, `--claude-md`, `--settings`); only `--all`, `--uninstall`, `--version`, `--dry-run`, `--force` remain
- **`--all` now installs everything**: Including MCP and all plugin groups (previously excluded MCP)

### Design Rationale
- Addresses context accumulation issue (#7): default install was injecting ~9k tokens of rules (including unused languages) + heavy plugin skill lists into every session
- Interactive menu replaces the need to remember CLI flags — users see all options at a glance with sensible defaults
- CLI flag removal: component-selection flags are redundant with the interactive menu; `--all` is the only non-interactive install path needed
- claude-mem separated as standalone toggle — it's the only plugin injecting ~3k tokens at SessionStart (observation index + session summary); other Extended plugins only register tool/skill names
- Non-interactive fallback preserved: headless/CI installs (no tty at all) install essential plugins only (no MCP); explicit `--all` installs everything including MCP and all plugin groups
- Unknown/removed CLI flags now exit with error instead of silently degrading

### Notes & Caveats
- `--all` now installs everything (all plugins, MCP, all language rules)
- Remote install (`bash <(curl ...)`) now shows interactive menu by default (v1.5.1+); add `--all` for non-interactive full install

## [1.3.0] - 2026-03-09

### Features
- Full uninstall now includes plugins and MCP by default (previously omitted)
- Install warning tracking: failed merges or plugin installs now skip version stamp and report warning count
- Uninstall backs up `settings.json` to `settings.json.bak` before removal
- `--all` flag now composes with other flags (e.g., `--all --mcp` installs everything plus MCP)
- Windows installer checks bash availability and warns if missing (required by statusline and hooks)
- Adversarial review skill no longer requires missing `brain/principles.md`; uses `reviewer-lenses.md` as self-contained source

### Bug Fixes
- VERSION environment variable sanitized to prevent command injection in remote install
- Repeated install no longer creates nested directories (e.g., `paper-reading/paper-reading/`)
- `stat` fallback order fixed: Linux `stat -c %Y` tried first, macOS `stat -f %m` as fallback
- Windows installer missing `tokenization` plugin in AI Research group (5/6 → 6/6)

- Self-improvement loop wording clarified: "auto-saved" → "Claude writes corrections driven by CLAUDE.md instructions"
- Uninstall examples annotated with "(incl. plugins & MCP)"
- Manual plugin install docs updated with all marketplace `add` commands and `name@marketplace` syntax

### Design Rationale
- Warning tracking prevents users from believing a partially-failed install is current
- Settings backup on uninstall prevents accidental loss of user-owned config merged by the installer
- VERSION sanitization closes a real attack vector in the remote install path (`bash -c` with untrusted input)

### Notes & Caveats
- `bypassPermissions` default unchanged (power-user config by design)
- Adversarial review still requires opposite CLI (`codex`/`claude`) — this is by design, not a bug

## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-07

### Features
- Windows support with PowerShell installer (`install.ps1`)
- Adversarial code review skill (cross-model review via opposite AI CLI)
- Tokenization plugin added to AI Research skill group (huggingface-tokenizers, sentencepiece)
- Cross-platform web search date instruction (system command with fallback)
- Codex branch link in README navigation

### Bug Fixes
- Statusline non-blocking for third-party API users
- Bash 3.2 compatibility (replace associative array with string matching)
- Retry logic (5 attempts) for network operations in installer
- Fallback to expired cache when usage API is rate-limited

### Design Rationale
- PowerShell installer mirrors bash installer logic for Windows parity
- Adversarial review replaces codex-cli MCP — cross-model challenge produces higher quality reviews than same-model delegation
- Web search date instruction ensures queries include current year by verifying system clock first

### Notes & Caveats
- PowerShell installer requires `winget` for `jq`/`gh` dependencies
- Adversarial review requires the opposite CLI installed (`codex` for Claude users, `claude` for Codex users)
- GitHub redirect from old repo name (`claude-code-config`) still works but canonical URL is now `awesome-claude-code-config`

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-05

### Features
- Gradient statusline showing model, cost, and context usage
- Version changelog policy in CLAUDE.md
- Project renamed to `awesome-claude-code-config`
- Backup logic removed from installer (replaced by smart merge)

### Design Rationale
- Statusline provides at-a-glance session awareness without interrupting workflow
- Changelog policy ensures design decisions are traceable alongside code

### Notes & Caveats
- Statusline reads from OS keychain for API credentials — requires keychain access
- Rename may break existing bookmarks; GitHub redirect handles this transparently

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-02

### Features
- Installer overhaul: remote install, smart merge, plugin groups, uninstall, version management
- Enhanced paper-reading skill with depth-first analysis and multi-perspective evaluation
- Code Review rule in CLAUDE.md
- Codex CLI MCP server integration

### Design Rationale
- Plugin-first architecture: skills installed from open-source ecosystems rather than bundled
- Smart merge preserves user customizations during upgrades
- Paper-reading skill uses Andrew Ng's three-perspective framework for balanced evaluation

### Notes & Caveats
- Plugin installer requires Python 3 and network access to GitHub
- MCP servers require separate credential configuration (Lark, GitHub PAT)

## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-25

### Features
- Initial release with CLAUDE.md global instructions
- Memory system with lessons-based self-correction loop
- Plugin marketplace with AI research, MCP servers, and paper-reading skill
- Feishu/Lark MCP and Context7 integration
- Installer with plugin group support

### Design Rationale
- Lessons-driven self-improvement: corrections recorded → auto-injected → stable patterns promoted to CLAUDE.md
- Plugin marketplace separates concern: CLAUDE.md manages behavior, plugins provide domain skills

### Notes & Caveats
- First public release — API and configuration format may change
